 My topic for this project is the impact of Russian invasion of Ukraine on refugee groups in and around Ukraine

 My parameters for the general search for refugee impact in the surrounding areas was:
 search_terms = ["bulgaria refugee crisis", "moldova refugee crisis", "hungary refugee crisis"]
 for the refugee crisis specifically naming Ukraine we chose these parameters:
 search_terms = ["ukraine situation", "2022 Ukrainian refugee crisis", "ukraine refugee crisis"]
 
 I want to make this comparison because of the holistic nature of the former Eastern Bloc countries, their collective response to refugee cycles can help define the difference in the crisis that is occurring in the area and the perspective of those who are native to the surrounding countries

 Some of the similarities between the word clouds are that the word refugee is front and center, which helps center the focus of the data as being on displaced peoples, as we move away from collective similarities  and towards differences we notice language implying violence when Ukraine is mentioned or centered like 'crisis' or 'war', while from the perspective of the neighboring countries we see matters of more civic natures, including the words 'migrant' and 'police'. 

 Its possible that when we focus on the neighboring countries as opposed to Ukraine that they view the matter as more of a strain on their resources and civic infrastructure rather than an existential threat. This is important as we consider their former status as a bloc. It could be inferred that the changing language surrounding the Ukrainian crisis could mean that these countries don't believe that the threat will continue beyond Ukraine's borders.

 My research could be improved in the future by using a wider range of search terms and gauging the relative level of threat determination by checking the gradient of language as it pertains to 'crisis' or 'threat' which means that we could create a variable map of which countries see the invasion of Ukraine as a threat to themselves. By doing this we could also better ascertain sentiment towards the refugee crisis overall. 

 I was suprised that the differences between the word maps told a story that focused on how countries though they were involved in the war rather than a continued support of those who were displaced
